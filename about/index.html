<p>I'm Morteza Milani, a student in the Department of Computer Science at <a href="http://www.sbu.ac.ir">SBU</a>, Iran. My research is in the intersection of Complex Networks and Systems Biology. My CV is available as pdf <a href="http://milani.github.io/about/cv.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>I have non-academic activities too. I work as Software Development Manager at <a href="http://pichak.co">Pichak</a> where we develop apps for smartphones. I also developed projects like <a href="http://appjs.com">AppJS</a> but I decided to stop spending time on side projects and focus more on my academic research as I should graduate next year. I'm learning how to be a good data scientist instead;) You can checkout my profile on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/morteza-milani/29/84/908">LinkedIn</a> for more information or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/morteza_milani">twitter</a> to get in touch.</p>
