title: Avoid Konfayakon
description: Avoid Major Refactors as much as possible
---

*Konfayakon* is a term we use at [Pichak](http://pichak.co) to refer to major refactors.
It is a persian term came from Quran with a change in the meaning. To konfayakon something
means to change it so much that it is no longer recognizable.

My experience shows the need for a major refactor is caused by writing spaghetti code to
deliver features as soon as possible one after another.

Teams developing projects should set a rule: Avoid Konfayakons! Believe me, you don't want
that! This simple rule has consequences:

* First, teams should value not only the final product, but the code itself. Code should be
clean and maintainable.
* Teams should set deadlines based on realistic assumptions. Never force a developer to deliver
a feature without giving him enough time for thinking, implementing and refactoring.
* The code should be reviewed by another developer before it is merged into the product to make
sure it is clean and well-formed.

Remember there is no room in tomorrow to refactor the code you write today. There is always
a new feature you want to code.
